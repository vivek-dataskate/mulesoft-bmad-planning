             walks 6-level tree; writes scaffold.profile; MD + CV menu items
  PM: reads FIELD_KNOWLEDGE.md; MS menu item with per-flow + global story templates
  Dev: reads FIELD_KNOWLEDGE.md; checks api-discovery contracts; MI menu item with
       full MUnit, idempotency, claim-check, and file-layout enforcement
CHUNK 4+5 AUDIT + FIX PASS [x] COMPLETE (2026-05-10)
  Opus-model adversarial audit found 71 issues (7 CRITICAL, 36 HIGH, 28 MEDIUM).
  All 71 fixed in priority order. Key fixes:
  - PLANNING_CONTEXT.md: corrected _bmad/custom/ paths (was .claude/skills/ — wrong)
  - decisions-schema.json: deduplicationTtlMinutes 60 → 1440 (was shorter than message TTL)
  - PLANNING_CONTEXT.md: idempotency TTL rule clarified — must equal messageTtlHours × 60
  - All 4 agent TOMLs: coverage floors unified (all 18 patterns covered, "all others=80%" added)
  - All 4 agent TOMLs: FIELD_KNOWLEDGE.md write-back requirement added
  - bmad-agent-analyst.toml: 4-branch connector lookup, both discovery trigger conditions,
    blocker-stop rule, staleness recording in prd.md, PII handling rule, MULESOFT_DESIGN_STANDARDS
    and prd-template.md added to persistent_facts
  - bmad-agent-architect.toml: per-class TTL policy table embedded, compensation decision rule
    (financial/provisioning → saga), EDA fit assessment mandate, cross-cutting patterns
    evaluation checklist, anti-patterns guard, scaffold profile rules embedded, CV menu
    now calls MCP (not just flags), Level 0 selection rules in MD prompt, scenario files
    mandatory at Level 1, dedup formula (= messageTtlHours × 60), architecture-template.md
    added to persistent_facts, watermark enforcement
  - bmad-agent-pm.toml: story-template.md added to persistent_facts; architecture.md Field
    Mapping/Business Rules/Open Items required reading; 4 conditional global stories added
    (wire tap, field encryption, IMC, contract confirmation); AI provider story added;
    removed "ask 3 questions" (PM has no questions — all in decisions.json);
    watermark AC added for pattern D; OAS/RAML per client platform; security-tier ACs
  - bmad-agent-dev.toml: scenario files required pre-implementation; idempotency TTL
    = messageTtlHours × 60 (not hardcoded 24h); error envelope format specified;
    retry table embedded; claim-check step 4 (delete after processing) added; per-env
    log levels specified; MULESOFT_DESIGN_STANDARDS added to persistent_facts
  - prd-template.md: staleness + freshness column added to Systems table; API Format column;
    credentials-available column in API Discovery Triggers; per-flow volume+latency in Flows
    table; Compliance and Data Residency section added; FIELD_KNOWLEDGE entries section;
    PII caution note on intake quotes
  - architecture-template.md: Decision Summary now includes TTL, compensation, AI rows;
    EDA verdict has 3 options (warranted / not warranted / Kafka required); Field Mapping
    table has Confirmed/Open Item status column; per-flow compensation rationale and saga
    steps in flow section; AI Integration section added; API-Led Architecture View section
    added; Idempotent Receiver TTL row includes class hint; region field un-hardcoded;
    Level 4 deduplication notes; sign-off checklist expanded with 9 new items
  - story-template.md: story ID scheme ({CLIENT}-{NNN}); Story Index has pattern + coverage
    floor columns; 5 new conditional global stories (wire tap, field encryption, IMC,
    contract confirmation, AI provider); MQ TTL story has all 5 event categories; MQ story
    has alert channel AC; Implement Flow story has claim-check AC, validation-before-
    downstream AC, pattern-conditional ACs table; MUnit story has structured test case table
    with mock column + extended error scenarios note; CI/CD story specifies Java 17 +
    mule-maven-plugin; Visualizer story has property location (mule-artifact.json)

CHUNK 5 — BMAD Templates [x] COMPLETE (2026-05-10)
  Files: templates/prd-template.md
         templates/architecture-template.md
         templates/story-template.md
  PRD: stakeholders, systems (registry status), flows, NFR, constraints, API discovery
       triggers, open items (blockers vs non-blockers), assumptions, out-of-scope
  Architecture: all 6 decision levels, per-flow Field Mapping table
    (Source Field | Source System | Target Field | Target System | Transform Rule),
    per-flow Business Rules section, per-flow Open Items section,
    semantic dissonance table, cross-cutting patterns, flow control config,
    EDA fit assessment, scaffold profile selection, architect sign-off checklist
  Story: global stories (error handler, MQ queues, secrets, CI/CD, Visualizer),
         per-flow block (API spec, flow impl, DataWeave, MUnit, monitoring alerts),
         story index, coverage floors, MUnit test case table, open-item TODO format
CHUNK 6 — Story Library  [ ] NOT STARTED
CHUNK 7 — XML+DWL Tmpl   [ ] NOT STARTED
CHUNK 8 — Scaffold Gen   [ ] NOT STARTED
  SCOPE UPDATED 2026-05-10:
  + Profile selection: minimal/standard/enterprise/regulated (computed from decisions.json)
  + MUnit stubs pre-scaffolded with happy path + 2 error scenarios per flow
  + Coverage floors enforced by pattern (80%/75%/60%) — NOT 100%
  + Wire-tap generated when profile=enterprise or regulated
  + Claim-check stub generated when payload>1MB indicated
  + Regulated profile: always generates field-encryption + audit-trail flow
CHUNK 9 — Client Repo Sh [ ] NOT STARTED
CHUNK 10 — E2E Test      [ ] NOT STARTED

NEW ARTIFACT 2026-05-10:
docs/FIELD_KNOWLEDGE.md  [x] CREATED — architect training + lesson accumulation system
